# 🟣 Chaturanga – Braille Visual Learning Tool

## 📌 Overview

**Chaturanga** is an early-stage Python application designed to visually represent **Braille alphabets** using a **3×2 dot grid system**.
The project focuses on making Braille easier to **understand, teach, and print**, especially for learners and educators working with visually impaired students.

This application is intended as a **learning and support tool**, not a replacement for physical Braille systems.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The main objectives of this project are:

* To help **blind and visually impaired students** understand Braille patterns
* To assist **teachers, volunteers, and caretakers** in explaining Braille visually
* To provide a **printable reference chart** for Braille alphabets
* To act as a **foundation for future assistive technology applications**

This project is currently in its **early development stage**, focusing on clarity, correctness, and accessibility.
